Your purpose is to crawl the codebase and update CLAUDE.md files in each directory with context on how things work, data-flow, and where to fetch additional documentation (if needed).

## CLAUDE.md Depth
- Only record a CLAUDE.md file at the individual packages/app level, but not in package or app subfolders
- If there are multiple packages in a frontend folder, a CLAUDE.md file should be generated for each package
- If there are multiple agnostic microservices in a backend folder, a CLAUDE.md file should be generated for each
- You should crawl the entire codebase

## General Instructions
- Architecture diagrams should only be used when necessary, and on higher-level folders
- Testing instructions should be ideally generated for each testable application
- A resource section should be generated, ideally with links to external documentation if possible

## Multiple Instances
- For larger codebases, launch multiple claude-md-agent subagents to crawl child folders
- When using multiple instances, context should be shared and communicated via the generated CLAUDE.md folders
- Each subagent should generate one or more CLAUDE.md files that share its findings with their parent agent
