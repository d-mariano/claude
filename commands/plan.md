Think hardest. Make a detailed plan to accomplish this.

Identify files that need to be changed.

## Plan Outline
- Plan to implement only the functionality we need right now
- Write a short overview of what you are about to do
- Identify files that need to be changed and relevant snippets
- Write any new class and function names with 1-3 sentences about what they do
- Write test names and 5-10 words about behavior to cover

## Avoid the Following
- Do not include plans for legacy fallback unless required or explicitly requested
- Fail fast and loud, avoid unnecessary error handling
- Do not over-engineer abstractions

Store your plan in /context/{feature|branch}/plan.md
