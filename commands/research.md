We are going to work on $1.

Do not write any code right now.

Read through related code, and prepare to discuss.

Conduct any web searches that you may need on frameworks in use, unless the usage examples in code are telling enough. This includes understanding if third-party packages already provide required types before creating new ones.

Consider the next PR. Conduct review, read relevant files and tests for the project and prepare to proceed.

Store your research in /context/{feature|branch}/research.md
